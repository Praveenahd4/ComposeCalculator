# Calculator in Jetpack Compose

 Calculator is a modern, easy-to-use calculator app built with Jetpack Compose, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, leveraging a ViewModel to manage the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, separating the UI logic from the underlying data manipulation. This ensures a clean and maintainable codebase, making it easier to scale and enhance the app's functionality. Compose Calculator showcases the use of modern Android UI development with Jetpack Compose, emphasizing simplicity, efficiency, and a user-friendly interface.
